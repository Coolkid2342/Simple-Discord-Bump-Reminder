# Simple Discord Bump Reminder

Simple Discord  Bump Reminder is to be used with the DISBOARD bot to remind you when your next bump is!

## Before Usuage

The bot you choose to use this with will need the Message Content Intent to be able to detect the DISBOARD bot.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.JS 16.6.0 or higher!


Stick the bot files into a folder and run
```npm
npm install
```
and change the bot token in ./config.json to your desired bot.

## Usage
When running
```
!d bump
```
the bot will automatically detect when the bump is completed and will start a timer. If the bot fails to detect the bump you can use
```
!forceReminder
```
